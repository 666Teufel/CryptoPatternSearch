I don't take any responsabilty if you win or loss. You are the one how decides what to do with it. it isnot Finacel Advise and sum may seem Profibil but I only had a small dataset I thing over Time lock add restults 1m all go near 50% win or loss.

If you get cuda needet install Cuda an go to https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/
